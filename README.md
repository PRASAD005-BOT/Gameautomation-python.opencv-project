This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to implement a virtual steering wheel for controlling a car in a game.

## Features
- Hand tracking using MediaPipe
- Steering wheel simulation
- Face mask overlay feature
- Real-time control using PyAutoGUI

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python steering_control.py
   ```

## Usage
- Place hands near the virtual steering wheel to control direction.
- Move hands up or down to accelerate or brake.
- Face tracking applies a mask overlay dynamically.
